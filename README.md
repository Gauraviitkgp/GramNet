Digitalising Villages

PS?
To solve internet connectivity issues in rural areas

Steps:
1.	Describe the PS
2.	Something about our project
3.	How it will create impact?
4.	How to solve the issue?
5.	How is it different from existing facilities?
6.	Way to give internet connection- router
7.	Expected problems to encounter
8.	Smooth functioning of the services
9.	Expansion of the services



1)Problem Statement:
- People of rural areas don’t have internet access and hence are intellectually poor. The way Jio revolutionized the telecom industry by providing cheap data packs for 4G enabled devices. It is really a revolution but period is jio really able to provide net facility in villages? Answer is almost no, only 5.7% of the total jio users are from rural areas! Now we are planning to revolutionize rural internet market.

2)Something about our project:
If we are able to successfully work out our model then we will be lending our hand in Modiji’s and Vasudharaji’s vision of Digital India and Make in India. Presently govt is working a lot and trying hard to provide internet facility to every remote village. Govt. is using optical fibre model to reach every village. But laying optical fibre is very difficult and also maintenance would very difficult. I think this is the time to make transitions from wired connections to wireless one. And the model which we are planning is majorly wireless and as we progress we will shift our project towards complete wireless sytem. Moreover to use the service user, need not fill a long form just they have to scan their aadhar card and he is ready to surf and scroll!

3)Impact of the project:
-All the villagers who don’t have internet access are seen to be intellectually poor and are very much behind the present generation. Internet is something which is most basic or fundamental requirement of every people and many people are not even enjoying 1% of the service what others are enjoying. After we successfully install our project we will be able to reach  out every people in the village and help them to grow in every sphere by providing internet facility to them.
In the course of installing the system we will also provide employment to villagers which in turn will add to the GDP of our country and national properity.
Since we are focusing on wireless connectivity so it would be easy to connect and also speed would be great. Initially we will be facing a lot of problems but if there is will there is a way! 

4) How to solve the issue?
-We are planning to provide Wi-Fi facility to every villagers by installing Wi-Fi routers at specific places in the village according to the population density using unidirectional and circular routers. Since people in villages are mostly economically poor so they can’t afford costly packs so we will have tailor made pack for every village according to economic, geographic, population and many other factors.
People in villages are reluctant to spend huge money for worthy thing but can spend little money on something, this is what a villager’s perception is! For example: if someone is providing them a net facility at RS400 for 3 months and provides 84GB data and at the same time other company is providing 500MB at Rs 5 for a day. Villagers would go for Rs 5 daily instead of Rs400 recharge this is very important aspect to know as we have thought like a villager to sort out their problem so we have decided to introduce tailor made pack for each and every village. 
To get the recharge done what all the user needs to do is scan, scan and choose! you are done wow!
If we provide them with a long form for the recharge then hardly any villager will show interest. So we kept it very simple as well as fascinating, connecting them with latest technologies and wonders. This will also help the govt. with Aadhaar card for everyone Scheme! Not just this even to log in to the site the user just needs to scan a QR code through which they can be redirected to our site!

5) How is it different form existing internet services?
-On this we would like to add just one line: tailor-made pack for users and it’s very simple to use, you just need to scan a QR code -> scan your aadhaar QR code ->choose your suitable pack-> and boom you are ready to surf net and download files at lighting speed. 

What do we mean by tailor-made pack?
-Since most of the telecom industries today introduce a pack and is applicable for all people throughout the country or state and these packs are not sutiable for villagers and hence villagers are not attracted towards this and we end up getting failure towards Digital India. We will overcome this problem by developing customised or tailored net packs for every village and upon reviews and comments we will keep on updating the pack. 

This was about price but how would users get their phone or Wi-Fi device recharged with packs? 

Gone are the days when we had to go to shops to recharge our cellphones. In this era of machines and technologies we should opt for some easy and fancy way, right?

So we have made it very simple such that even an uneducated person can easily avail internet facility, what all they need to do is just scan and surf!
Since this project is mainly for villagers and most of them are uneducated and are very reluctant to type even a single letter but enjoys clicking! So be it, we have taken special care for it and have minimized it to a great extent they don’t have to write anything they just need to scan and click on appropriate options. It is very practical that QR codes are not very much harnessed and we are looking forward to exploit QR code to a great extent in order to minimize typing and provide ease to the users. We will paste the QR code of the website at the gate of every house and shop and public places so that they never feel like we are away from them!

Now this was very much about ease of activating internet service what after this?? 

Yeah folks after activating pack a new wireless and exciting world is waiting for you!
Since we are using Wi-Fi so we don’t have any speed restrictions like 3g and 4g, which do have speed restrictions but with Wi-Fi we can provide internet at any speed! Isn’t it fascinating we love freedom so why should be bounded with 3G and 4G?

Also purchasing 3G and 4G devices are not that much easy for villagers but Wi-Fi enabled devices are mostly cheap and can be afforded by any person! Even in tablets and many laptops we don’t have sim card slot but we can use Wi-Fi. So why to buy high priced smartphone to use net when you can use it at very cheap Wi-Fi enabled devices.

6)How to provide Wi-Fi facility?
- By using wi-fi routers at specific places so that whole village is covered. 
- Packs will be tailor made for every village: (for example)
•	20MB Data for 1hr @Rs2 only /-
•	50MB Data for 3hr @Rs5 only /-
•	300MB Data for 1 day @Rs19 only/- 
•	1.5GB Data for 7 days @Rs99 only/-
•	20GB Data for 29 days @Rs199 only/-

7)Expected Problems to encounter while setting up the internet service
•	Power issues: since in India there is hardly any village having 24hr electricity connection so we need to frame some plan so that we could power each and every Wi-Fi router 24*7. Since power consumed by a router is very low so it can be fulfilled by using electricity when available and use solar plate energy for rest of the time.

•	Connectivity Issues: we will partner with nearest best broadband providing ISP like Bharat-net, airtel etc in case the ISP is having some issues we will switch to best wireless ISP available in the region and will ensure that internet is available 24*7

•	 Human resource and non-technical issues:
Getting non-technical working members in villages won’t be an issue as most of the people there are unemployed so our project will completely change the life of poors as we will hire many people to ensure everything works fine. For technical issues we need to appoint a guy who has sound knowledge of everything related to routers and Wi-Fi devices.
This will greatly add to the GDP of our country and reducing unemployment

•	Social issues:
After introduction of internet villagers will get less time to interact with each other and hence the unity and bond which they share today would not remain same after introduction of internet. They may be virtually connected but that connection can’t compensate for their meeting of the floor sitting and discussing for hours and like….
But again for the development and growth of people they need to learn how to manage both digital and real relations with people as what I personally feel is that if you are able to withstand and win under lot of difficulties, then it is way better than just getting through without any challenge! So sooner or later they will have to understand and know the importance of maintaining exact balance between virtual world and real world. Cons of using internet is very less than pros so we should not abandon the introduction of internet for this reason.

•	Language issues: 
Since most of the people in villages are illiterate so there will be lot of problems as they won’t be able to use internet. But it is the case like that with JIO, JIO introduced cheap “4G” data packs when 4G handsets were very few in numbers but the introduction of Jio revolutionized the industry and the sale of 4G handsets increased tremendously similarly in our case if we introduce internet in very attractive and cheap rate then villagers in the urge of using internet will get education and hence we will contribute directly in minimizing illiteracy!

8)Smooth functioning of the services:
For smooth functioning of our services in existing villages we will regularly take feedback from the people and would keep on updating and introducing new features.
   
9)Expansion of the services:
We will keep storing the data like no of visits on our site and according to these data we will keep expanding our services to more and more villages and ultimately would cover whole country.
